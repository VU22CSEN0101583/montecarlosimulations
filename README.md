# montecarlosimulations
This project demonstrates the use of Monte Carlo simulations in Python to model outcomes under uncertainty. By running thousands of iterations on historical datasets, the tool estimates probability distributions, risk levels, and volatility patterns, enabling better scenario forecasting and decision-making.

Originally applied on financial datasets (via Yahoo Finance), the methodology is generalizable to business risk modeling, demand forecasting, and strategic planning.

📊 Monte Carlo Simulation for Stock Price Forecasting
📌 Overview
This project demonstrates the use of Monte Carlo simulations in Python to model stock price movements under uncertainty. Using historical data from Yahoo Finance, the model runs thousands of randomized simulations to estimate possible future price paths, probability distributions, and risk metrics.

The methodology is generalizable beyond stocks — it can be applied to risk analysis, demand forecasting, and strategic decision-making in consulting and business contexts.
