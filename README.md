# montecarlosimulations
This project demonstrates the use of Monte Carlo simulations in Python to model outcomes under uncertainty. By running thousands of iterations on historical datasets, the tool estimates probability distributions, risk levels, and volatility patterns, enabling better scenario forecasting and decision-making.

Originally applied on financial datasets (via Yahoo Finance), the methodology is generalizable to business risk modeling, demand forecasting, and strategic planning.
